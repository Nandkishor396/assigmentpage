      <h3><mark>Finding Tudor Girlhoods: Margaret Roper</mark></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Margaret More Roper was not born to the peerage of England, but her father, Thomas More, was a great lawyer as well as friend, Lord Chancellor, and – finally – enemy of King Henry VIII. She was born in 1505 as the eldest child of More and his first wife, Joanna (Jane) Colt More. She was followed by four siblings (three girls and one boy) before her mother passed away when Margaret was only six. Her father remarried shortly (literally just one month) after her mothers’ death to Alice Middleton, bringing a step-sister (also named Alice) into the household.</li>
        <li>Thomas More believed that girls should be just as educated as boys, if only for the sake of piety. More ran a school for his seven total children (he adopted the neighbor’s child after her own mother passed) out of their home, called The Barge. More taught the children himself until Henry VIII required him more often at court. When Margaret was twelve years old, More hired teacher and fellow humanist, William Gonnell, to take over the children’s education, teaching them subjects such as “Latin, Greek, logic, philosophy, theology, mathematics, and astronomy.” Margaret was an extremely adept pupil and was acknowledged as her father’s favorite child. He nicknamed her his “Dearest Meg.”</li>
        <li>Despite the humanist teachings and More’s radical thoughts regarding education, this was still the 16th century. Margaret was married at the age of sixteen to her fathers friend and fellow lawyer, William Roper. He was nine years her senior, practically the same age for the time. The couple had five children together: Elizabeth, Margaret, Thomas, Mary, and Anthony. Their eldest, Elizabeth, was born in 1523, when Margaret was just eighteen. Margaret did not let motherhood keep her from her studies, however. She translated Precatio Dominica, the work of her father’s friend and famed humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, from Latin to English, with the translated title, A devout treatise upon the Paternoster. It was published in 1524, when she was nineteen years old, making her “the first non-royal woman to publish a book she had translated into English”. She was a renowned writer and translator, but sadly most of her work, such as her treatise, The Four Laste Thynges, have been lost to time. </li>
        <li>Unfortunately, Margaret’s life took a downward turn in the next ten years. Her father refused to acknowledge Henry VIII as the Head of the Church of England. After several years, Henry had More arrested in 1534. Margaret visited her father while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, smuggling letters for him and trying to get him to sign the oath Henry required. More kept refusing, however, and in 1535 he was tried for treason and beheaded. Margaret was able to say goodbye to him as he was led to the block and was the last of More’s family to see him alive. As was the case for most traitors, his head was mounted on a pike and kept on London Bridge. When it was removed, Margaret bribed the executioner to give the head to her, which she “preserved…in a leaden box”</li>
        <li>After More’s death, Margaret and her husband worked together to publish all of her father’s works. However, just nine years later and shortly after the birth of her youngest child in 1544, Margaret passed away. She was only thirty-nine years old. Margaret was buried in her family’s tomb with the head of her father interred with her.</li>

        <h3><mark>Finding Tudor Girlhoods: Mary Howard</mark></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When Mary Howard was born in 1519, she was already a very well-connected lady. She was the daughter and granddaughter of the two highest nobles in England. At the time of her birth her father, Thomas Howard, was Earl of Surrey, but he was raised to his familial title of Duke of Norfolk when Mary was five years old. Her mother, Elizabeth Stafford, was the daughter of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham.</li>
          <li>While we do not know the details of Mary’s childhood (as is often the case with women of the Tudor age), we do know that she had a thorough education, as befitted a young lady of her rank. She was renowned for her intellect and beauty, always a dangerous combination in the minds of men. Her own father described her as being “too wise for a woman”. It was during Mary’s formative years that her first cousin, Anne Boleyn, was engaged to the king. This brought the already powerful Howard family further up the social ladder.</li>
          <li>After these events, in November 1533, Mary was married to Henry FitzRoy. Both were only fourteen years old at the time. Because of their age and the king’s concern for his son’s health, they did not live together or consummate the marriage. After the marriage, they each went back to their separate homes, though Mary was elevated to the status of Lady-in-Waiting to her cousin. While at court, she befriended the king’s niece, Lady Margaret Douglas, as well as a clique of other young courtiers. Mary began circulating a blank book among the group in which they all contributed poetry (including some pieces by Sir Thomas Wyatt and Mary’s own brother, who was nicknamed the “Poet Earl”), transcriptions, and compositions</li>
          <li>The year 1536 began a period of troubles for Mary and the whole Howard clan. Anne Boleyn was executed for treason in May, leaving her relatives in disfavor with the king. In July of that same year, Mary became a widow at only seventeen years old, when FitzRoy died suddenly of a sudden illness. As a widow, Mary was entitled to a jointure, lands and money to be paid to her since her husband was no longer able to provide for her. However, Henry VIII claimed that since the marriage wasn’t consummated, the marriage was not valid and so he did not have to give her her jointure. Surprisingly for the time, Mary did not timidly back down in the face of the king, but actually fought for her rights as his daughter-in-law. She constantly berated her father to help her, but after their fall from grace, Norfolk was loath to make the king angry.</li>
          <li>While this legal battle was going on, many other scandals had been in the works. Before FitzRoy died, Mary had actually been assisting Margaret Douglas in her affair with Mary’s uncle, another Thomas Howard. The two actually pre-contracted themselves earlier that year, which was illegal. As a relative of the king’s and possible heir to the throne, Margaret could not marry without the king’s permission. The pre-contract was discovered around the time of FitzRoy’s death. Henry arrested the couple, sending Margaret to an abbey and Thomas to the Tower, where he eventually passed away. Mary was saved from Henry’s wrath due to a combination of recent widowhood and Margaret’s defense of her friend, insisting Mary had no idea of the pre-contract.</li>

        <h3><mark>Finding Tudor Girlhoods: Margaret Plantagenet</mark></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The life of Margaret Plantagenet (later Pole) had always been tragic. She was born in 1473, toward the end of the War of the Roses, to George, Duke of Clarence, brother of the head of the York faction, King Edward IV. Her mother was Isabel Neville, the eldest daughter of Richard “The Kingmaker” Neville, Earl of Warwick. Isabel passed away shortly after the birth of a young son (who did not live much longer) when Margaret was only three years old and her surviving brother, Edward, was one. Her father was blinded by grief and actually executed two of Isabel’s servants after accusing them of poisoning the Duchess</li>
          <li>He did attempt to remarry, vying for the hand of Mary, Duchess of Burgundy (his sister, Margaret’s step-daughter), but Edward IV and their sister both rejected the idea. In 1478, less than two years after his wife’s death, Clarence was charged with treason and sentenced to death. There were rumors that Edward allowed Clarence to choose his own manner of execution. Clarence, not believing his brother would truly have him put to death, chose to be drowned in a cask of his favorite Malmsey wine. Edward complied, privately executing Clarence according to his wishes. According to later rumors, Margaret wore a bracelet with the charm of a wine cask in honor of her father.</li>
          <li>Young Margaret and Edward were made wards of the crown after the death of their father. King Edward placed the children in the care of their maternal aunt, Anne Neville, and her husband Richard, Duke of Gloucester (their paternal uncle). When Margaret was ten years old, her uncle Edward died, leaving her young cousin as Edward V. However, their uncle Richard declared the children of Edward IV illegitimate and kept Edward V and his brother Richard, Duke of York in the Tower of London until their disappearance.</li>
          <li>Since Clarence had been Richard’s next eldest brother, Margaret’s brother, Edward, should have been next in line for the throne, followed by Margaret herself. Richard circumvented this by claiming the Clarence children were barred from the line of succession due to their father’s treason charge. Richard took the throne himself as Richard III. Margaret and Edward were sent to live in York, along with their cousins, the daughters of Edward IV. Despite this constant upheaval, Margaret was given an education worthy of her status. “In addition to reading and writing, she received instruction in playing musical instruments such as the virginals, she learned how to sew and how to manage a household”.</li>
          <li>In 1485, when Margaret was twelve, Richard III was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth. His challenger, the Lancastrian Henry Tudor, became Henry VII by right of conquest, and married her cousin, Elizabeth of York. Margaret and Edward were brought back to court and put in the care of Henry’s mother, Margaret Beaufort. However, though Elizabeth, as the eldest child of Edward IV, had the strongest claim, Edward was still the last male of the Yorkist line. Henry therefore viewed him as a threat, despite his young age. In 1486, around the birth of Henry’s own heir, Arthur, Edward was sent to the Tower of London. After the disappearance of their cousins, the notorious “Princes in the Tower”, this was probably terrifying for Margaret and Edward both. Margaret was forced to continue on as though nothing untoward was happening, however. She attended Arthur’s christening in 1486 and Elizabeth’s coronation in 1487.</li>
